type="abstract">This dissertation is a research on the creation art of pottery building in the Han Dynasty.Pottery building,a kind of miniature sculpture imitating the real ones,serves as a typical burial object embodying the burial etiquette,social belief,cultural system and handicraft technology during two periods of the Han Dynasty（the Western Han Dynasty,206 BC--AD 24 and the Eastern Han Dynasty,AD 25-220）.It can be seen not only as a materialization of the burial etiquette,but also a reflection of the mindset and technical proficiency of the folk art of the Han Dynasties.Meanwhile,imitating the real building,it serves as the mirror image of realistic architectural shape and technology.This dissertation,with the research on interrelated dynamic field between the shaping,manufacturing and consuming of burial objects,represents the historical context and cultural field of the creation,and reviews the tradition of the object creation of Chinese people under the context that traditional culture has been increasingly highlighted,adopting newly discovered material and new methodology.Firstly,the data on the shape,structure and components of the pottery building in the Han Dynasty have been collected,categorized and confirmed.When it comes to the shape,pottery building takes the form of one door multi-story building,double eave roof building and building complex.By the way,if classified by the function it serves,it can be categorized as warehouse,watchtower,and waterside pavilion.As for the structure of the building,wooden frame structure is the mainstream at that time,and a key element propelled the transformation from the high-platform building during the pre-Qin period（before 221 BC）to the high-rise building during the Han Dynasty,a time witnessed unprecedented development of Chinese traditional architecture in the history.But wood is nearly impossible to stand the test of the weather and time,so wooden frame structure constructed at that time has basically disappeared.What remains to this day are a few stone frame buildings,such as the Zhuwei Stone Chamber1 and Xiaotang Mountain Memorial Temple2 in Shandong Province.Since the beginning of the 20 th century with the rise of Chinese archeology by main means of field investigations and excavations,a wealth of data on building archaeology in Han Dynasty has been obtained.“Pottery building” excavated is the empirical data that we can use to restore history and deduce ancient culture.Secondly,the perspective of ancient art of creation has been employed to probe into the pottery building in the Han Dynasty.Pottery building,if looked as a “design works”,is in the first place the manifestation of the rites,system changes and the will of the rulers with regard to the combination of funerary object in the Han Dynasty,and in the second place the representation of the development of burial culture in terms of the shape,material and specification of the burial objects.It is also the reflection of the dynamic game process of all parties involved in funeral rites including the rulers and the ruled in particular space-time context.Moreover,social etiquette and customs are also reflected in the form of funerary objects through the process of this game.Finally,the origin of the pottery building creation from technology,material and specification has been explored.With social development,the change of belief and the development of pottery technology and a series of changes in the building specification bring about constant richness and popularity of varied types of pottery building from the middle and late period of the Western Han Dynasty to the late Eastern Han Dynasty.Meanwhile,inquiries about inner motives of the transformation of obsequies belief and the types of funerary object in the Han Dynasty have been made from the perspective of social class,social belief and culture.It can be concluded that during the period of the Han Dynasty（either in the Western Han or Eastern Han Dynasty）,new funeral system and etiquette came into being thereupon with social structure changing greatly,and the number of literati and feudal landlords increasing sharply.Burial system transformed from “that in the Zhou Dynasty（1059 BC-771 BC）” to “that in the Han Dynasty”,and the funerary objects in Han Dynasty lost their deity,and in turn gained some humanity,while people’s mindset turned from witchcraft worship to practicability and rationality.Pottery building is the typical representative of funerary objects in this period.The creation of pottery building is based on the concept of “when manufacturing an article or an implement it is necessary to refer to its shape or drawing”.It is a virtual miniature space for the dead,not only the product of social customs change,but also the representation of social status.The studies of this dissertation proceed from specific objects,manage to restore the historical scenario,and do a deep research into the imitative,symbolic and ceremonial features of pottery building creation in the Han Dynasty so as to explore the intrinsic cultural mechanism of folk creation art in its course of development and decline.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
